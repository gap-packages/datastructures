ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz",

##  If not all of the archive formats mentioned above are provided, these
##  can be produced at the GAP side. Therefore it is necessary to know which
##  files of the package distribution are text files which should be unpacked
##  with operating system specific line breaks.
##  The package wrapping tools for the GAP distribution and web pages will
##  use a sensible list of file extensions to decide if a file
##  is a text file (being conservative, it may miss a few text files).
##  These rules may be optionally prepended by the application of rules
##  from the PackageInfo.g file. For this, there are the following three
##  mutually exclusive possibilities to specify the text files:
##
##    - specify below a component 'TextFiles' which is a list of names of the
##      text files, relative to the package root directory (e.g., "lib/bla.g"),
##      then all other files are taken as binary files.
##    - specify below a component 'BinaryFiles' as list of names, then all other
##      files are taken as text files.
##    - specify below a component 'TextBinaryFilesPatterns' as a list of names
##      and/or wildcards, prepended by 'T' for text files and by 'B' for binary
##      files.
##
##  (Remark: Just providing a .tar.gz file will often result in useful
##  archives)
##
##  These entries are *optional*.
