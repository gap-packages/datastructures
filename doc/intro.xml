<Heading>Purpose and goals of this package</Heading>

The <Package>datastructures</Package> package for &GAP; has two main goals:
<List>
  <Item>Provide abstract interfaces for commonly used datastructures</Item>
  <Item>Provide good low-level implementations for these datastructures</Item>
</List>

By default the <Package>datastructures</Package> package is not automatically
loaded by &GAP; when it is installed. You must load the package with
<C>LoadPackage("IO");</C> before its functions become available.<P/>
