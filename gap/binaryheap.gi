# This file contains a GAP implementation of a binary max-heap.
#
# Some hints for writing efficient binary heap implementations:
# <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6531543>
#
# Note that while there are other heap datastructures which in
# theory have better asymptotical behavior than binary heaps, in
# real-world applications, a well-tunes binary heap often
# outperforms other heap implementations anyway, due to its
# simplicity, low constant (in O-notation) and cache friendliness.
