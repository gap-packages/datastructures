#! @Chapter Hash Functions
#!
#! @Section Introduction
#!
#! A hash function in datapackages is a function H which
#! maps a value X to a small integer (where a small integer
#! is an integer in the range [-2^28..2^28-1] on a 32-bit
#! system, and [-2^60..2^60-1] on a 64-bit system), under
#! the requirement that if X=Y, then H(X)=H(Y).
#!
#! A variety of hash functions are provided by datastructures, with
#! different behaviours. A bad choice of hash function
#! can lead to serious performance problems.
#!


#! @Section Hash Functions

#! Hashes any values built from the basic built-in types
#! of GAP, namely
#! integers, booleans, lists, records, permutations,
#! transformations and partial permutations.
#!
#! Also this function will takes a variadic length
#! list of arguments, treating more than one argument
#! as equivalent to a list, so
#! HashBasic(x,y,z) = HashBasic([x,y,z]).
DeclareGlobalFunction("HashBasic");

#! datastructures provides two hash functions for permutation groups.
#! Hash_PermGroup_Fast is faster, but will return the same
#! value for groups with the same size, orbits and transitivity.
DeclareGlobalFunction("Hash_PermGroup_Fast");

#! datastructures provides two hash functions for permutation groups.
#! Hash_PermGroup_Complete is slower, but is extremely unlikely
#! to return the same hash for two different groups.
DeclareGlobalFunction("Hash_PermGroup_Complete");
